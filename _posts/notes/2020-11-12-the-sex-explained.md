[Sexual Fantasies](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81160763)

* **Background**: 
	* According to his survey, [97%](https://i.imgur.com/DpSQIPh.png) of American adults have had a sexual fantasy, as in imagined an arousing sexual scenario. Eighty-seven percent have at least one a week. And [52%](https://i.imgur.com/rCSSJ0S.png) have at least one a day. 52% And though we might think our fantasies are super weird and unique... By and large, most people, regardless of gender, are fantasizing about the same things.
	* And while [79%](https://i.imgur.com/WpepozC.png) in Lehmiller's study said they want to act out their favorite fantasy of all time, only 23% said they'd actually tried. 
* **Questions**: So who and what are we fantasizing about? And what do our fantasies say about us?
* **What**? Most of our fantasies fall into three genres: 
	* [group sex](https://i.imgur.com/dBhYhyT.png), e.g. [threesome](https://i.imgur.com/xhFfnlx.png)
	* novelty, e.g. public
	* power and control, e.g. that scene in Mrs. and Mr. Smith.
* **Why**? Most of our fantasies reflect basic human needs: Feeling desired and validated, breaking out of our routines, and coping with anxieties.
* **How**? Often fantasies come from a variety of different places: some memory of something, some book that you read. It becomes this kind of mishmosh in your mind. 
* **Warning**: But there's a lot of variability in sexual fantasies, and they **don't tell you anything reliable about you**. If you have fantasies that disturb you or scare you, and you wonder what they mean, they don't mean a lot. So, don't worry so much about them.
* **Tips**: 
	* If you're in a loving, intimate relationship, where you are sexual with somebody that you're very trusting of them, and you feel like you can share these taboo parts of yourself, that can be a really good way to sort of see **how intimate we can be**. Real intimacy isn't just sharing the beauty of who we are, it's also sharing the ugly, and the ugly can actually be very gratifying.
	* There's a very safe way to work through all fetishes and all kinds of ideas and kinks through [BDSM](https://i.imgur.com/rOlDZyn.png). It's actually a wonderful way to do that. It's one of the great things about sexuality. It can bring us **closer** in a way that maybe other forms of communication can't.
