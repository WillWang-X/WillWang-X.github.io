[Sexual Fantasies](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81160763)

* **Background**: 
	* According to his survey, [97%](https://i.imgur.com/DpSQIPh.png) of American adults have had a sexual fantasy, as in imagined an arousing sexual scenario. Eighty-seven percent have at least one a week. And [52%](https://i.imgur.com/rCSSJ0S.png) have at least one a day. 52% And though we might think our fantasies are super weird and unique... By and large, most people, regardless of gender, are fantasizing about the same things.
	* And while [79%](https://i.imgur.com/WpepozC.png) in Lehmiller's study said they want to act out their favorite fantasy of all time, only 23% said they'd actually tried. 
* **Questions**: So who and what are we fantasizing about? And what do our fantasies say about us?
* **What**? Most of our fantasies fall into three genres: 
	* [group sex](https://i.imgur.com/dBhYhyT.png), e.g. [threesome](https://i.imgur.com/xhFfnlx.png)
	* novelty, e.g. public
	* power and control, e.g. that scene in Mrs. and Mr. Smith.
* **Why**? Most of our fantasies reflect basic human needs: Feeling desired and validated, breaking out of our routines, and coping with anxieties.
* **How**? Often fantasies come from a variety of different places: some memory of something, some book that you read. It becomes this kind of mishmosh in your mind. 
* **Warning**: But there's a lot of variability in sexual fantasies, and they **don't tell you anything reliable about you**. If you have fantasies that disturb you or scare you, and you wonder what they mean, they don't mean a lot. So, don't worry so much about them.
* **Tips**: 
	* If you're in a loving, intimate relationship, where you are sexual with somebody that you're very trusting of them, and you feel like you can share these taboo parts of yourself, that can be a really good way to sort of see **how intimate we can be**. Real intimacy isn't just sharing the beauty of who we are, it's also sharing the ugly, and the ugly can actually be very gratifying.
	* There's a very safe way to work through all fetishes and all kinds of ideas and kinks through [BDSM](https://i.imgur.com/rOlDZyn.png). It's actually a wonderful way to do that. It's one of the great things about sexuality. It can bring us **closer** in a way that maybe other forms of communication can't.


[Attraction](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062193)

* Q: Why are we attracted to some people... and not others?
* A: According to the latest research,	‎attraction mostly comes down to four main pillars:
	* [physical appearance](https://i.imgur.com/JOYStcM.png)
	* [geography](https://i.imgur.com/gUsI3d8.png), e.g. hanging around them a lot
	* [similarity](https://i.imgur.com/HBum4Qp.png), e.g. Opposites almost never attract.
	* [reciprocity](https://i.imgur.com/0xR6MeA.png), e.g. sharing your most treasured memories
* **What** (Research)
	* Responses from [straight men](https://i.imgur.com/9AjoY9b.png), [gay men](https://i.imgur.com/JQMAHKj.png), [straight women](https://i.imgur.com/urJqoGF.png), [lesbians](https://i.imgur.com/R7tTzKD.png)
		* But the women, they were turned on by pretty much everything.
	* In 2015, researchers had hundreds of identical twins rate faces and plotted the results.
	* A [1989 study](https://i.imgur.com/wShTeJY.png) of 37 cultures around the world
		* men care more about their female partners being attractive and young... as in "fertile, " to have more babies to pass on their genes, while women cared more about financial capacity, ambition, and industriousness. As in, they were or were going to be rich to provide for all those babies.
	* A study of profile pictures on the dating app Tinder
		* [Straight women](https://i.imgur.com/IfmThjy.png) were more likely than mento take selfies angled from above, so their eyes and foreheads looked big, and everything else looked smaller. So they look younger, aka, more fertile.
		* While [men](https://i.imgur.com/Qaoz8uO.png) were more likely to use selfies angled from below, so they look taller and more dominant. In the animal world, that means"better able to acquire resources. "In the human world, that means "rich.
	* [Rating](https://i.imgur.com/zSHKbU9.png) of ZULU men living in south Africa
		* When it comes to sexual orientation, [environmental](https://i.imgur.com/Af4bSV9.png) factors play a much more important role than genes.
	* the moment of attraction in difference culture:
		* France: [lightning bolt](https://i.imgur.com/wORmLF0.png)
		* Arabic: [hawa](https://i.imgur.com/hnwTSZ2.png), a wind
		* China: [yuanfen](https://i.imgur.com/u8uIHpK.png), a fated force
		* Japan: [koi no yokan](https://i.imgur.com/pBEmXNb.png), the feeling when you meet someone that you're bound to fall in love.
	* Dopamine & [fight-or-flight hormones](https://i.imgur.com/o7dnoE1.png).
		* Dopamine gives you the same pleasurable boost-as [eating sugar or taking drugs](https://i.imgur.com/52rvszT.png) with the same powerful cravings.
		* And then there's norepinephrineand adrenaline. The fight-or-flight hormones.
	* Misconception
		* There is no evidence of any link between large breasts and a pretty face and fertility, all right? If that were true, our planet would be populated only with beautiful, large-breasted women, and that is obviously not true.
		* But when geneticists are talking about the environment, we're talking about literally everything that's not a gene.
		* So, it's important to remember that "genetic" doesn't mean "fixed,"	‎and "environmental" doesn't mean "unfixed." The gene environment balance	‎for a trait doesn't really say anything about the fixedness of that trait.
