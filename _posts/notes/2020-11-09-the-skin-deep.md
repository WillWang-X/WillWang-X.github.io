> In 2014, we launched an interactive documentary project called **{THE AND}**. The premise was simple: film an emotional conversation between two people as they asked intimate questions, and invite the viewer into their emotional space. Our end goal is to build the world’s first digital database of human connection - a searchable public library of feelings, if you will. [[theskindeep.com](https://www.theskindeep.com/about-us)]

## Why

> I want to speak the way they do. It's been a life long struggle of mine, not being able to express myself vocally. I don't know if it's low vocabulary, or if there's a deeper reason. But my goodness if I could get advice from them about how to speak in a way that so perfectly gets their message across, i'd be so freaking grateful!
