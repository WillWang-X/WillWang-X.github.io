## What

[Memory](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062188)：

* **Story, place, and emotion** are the foundation of some of our strongest memories.
* So this poses the question: Why would we have a memory system that is so unreliable and error-prone if it was designed to remember the past? It **weaves together memories of the past and dreams of the future to create your sense of self**.

[Dreams](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062189)：

* It looks like REM sleep doesn't just help us remember, it helps us **forget**. Forgetting is really an important part of learning and it seems like REM sleep is really important for erasing things that our brain needs to erase, that it doesn't need to store, so you can incorporate new pieces of information.
* I think in REM sleep, the brain is creating dreams that are not designed to settle on a single answer, but to **help us realize all the possible answers** that are out there. If you're not focused on one particular route through the maze, you might discover paths you never knew were possible. We can test out new ideas, put things together without the constraints of logic.
* It might be that part of the function of REM sleep dreaming is to identify sort of **wacky associations, connections**, that we would never discover while we're awake.
* Creativity is nothing more than taking information we already have and seeing how it **fits together** in a new and exciting way.

[Anxiety](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062190):

* People with clinical anxiety often **can't reason their way out of the feeling**, because the logical part of the brain is **unable to rein** in the [amygdala](https://i.imgur.com/g52zXTU.png).
* **What**? The different types of anxiety disorders can be grouped by the kinds of fears that are involved. There are [4](https://i.imgur.com/JKqozr9.png):
	* **Catastrophic** fears, these are beliefs that something really bad is going to happen.
	* Fear of **evaluation**. ‎That's the hallmark of social anxiety, the most common anxiety disorder, a persistent debilitating fear of being watched and judged.
	* Fear of **losing control**.  It's a big part of panic disorder. You fear the loss of control that comes with panic attacks.  Agoraphobia takes this to an extreme.	 You avoid public places that might trigger an attack.	
	* And a fear of **uncertainty**, of not knowing what's going to happen.	This area includes generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD, a fixation on impulses and thoughts
* **Where** do all these anxiety disorders come from?
	* Well, some of it is **[inherited](https://i.imgur.com/lQMudFZ.png)**. If you have a parent with anxiety, you're more likely to be anxious yourself. 
	* And women are up to **[two](https://i.imgur.com/fzZSkkf.png) times** more likely to have an anxiety disorder than men.
	* Anxiety also seems to have something to do with the balance of chemicals in your brain. ‎Probably the most famous one these days is **[serotonin](https://i.imgur.com/PI8ZjNy.png)**.
	* Your brain is an **association** machine. It connects things together. e.g. [Little Albert](https://i.imgur.com/xdlUypT.png) & white (e.g. Santa Claus)
	* Or is **social media** really driving an increase in anxiety? 
		* I feel like we have created the **automobile**. The automobile has gained complete penetration in society and everyone's driving around, and we haven't invented the safety belt yet.
	* e.g. This cartoon from a 1906 Punch magazine paints **the wireless telegraph** as a threat to natural human interactions.
* **How**? One 2015 review of 234 studies compared the effects of doing nothing,	exercise, placebo pills, therapy, mindfulness meditation, and medication. They found the most effective treatment was **a combination of drugs and therapy**. One of the most popular types of therapy is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, where you talk with a therapist to alter negative thought and behavior patterns.
