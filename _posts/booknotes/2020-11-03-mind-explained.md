## What

[Memory](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062188)：

* **Story, place, and emotion** are the foundation of some of our strongest memories.
* So this poses the question: Why would we have a memory system that is so unreliable and error-prone if it was designed to remember the past? It **weaves together memories of the past and dreams of the future to create your sense of self**.

[Dreams](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062189)：

* It looks like REM sleep doesn't just help us remember, it helps us **forget**. Forgetting is really an important part of learning and it seems like REM sleep is really important for erasing things that our brain needs to erase, that it doesn't need to store, so you can incorporate new pieces of information.
* I think in REM sleep, the brain is creating dreams that are not designed to settle on a single answer, but to **help us realize all the possible answers** that are out there. If you're not focused on one particular route through the maze, you might discover paths you never knew were possible. We can test out new ideas, put things together without the constraints of logic.
* It might be that part of the function of REM sleep dreaming is to identify sort of **wacky associations, connections**, that we would never discover while we're awake.
* Creativity is nothing more than taking information we already have and seeing how it **fits together** in a new and exciting way.
